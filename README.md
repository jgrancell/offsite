## Objectives

Offsite provides a command-line (and hopefully eventually GUI) tool to allow you to reserve a portion of your disk space for your friends' offsite encrypted backups, while they do the same for you.

Following the 3-2-1 rule, offsite aims to provide an encrypted backup in a geographically different region from whatever machine you're looking to back up. Whether you are running offsite on a small Raspberry Pi at your parents house, you're running offsite with a group of gaming friends you've met on Discord, or you're using it on a Digital Ocean/AWS/Linode/whatever provider's secure VPS on the other side of the planet -- your data is backed up someone geographically different.

## Features

Offsite is currently in active development, and not yet ready for Alpha. Features for the Alpha are planned to include:

* Selecting multiple directories for regular, scheduled backups.
* Sending encrypted backups to your friends to store on their device(s).
* Defining a set amount of space that your friends can use to back up their own data.
* A robust tracker system to allow the platform to work without static IP addresses.
